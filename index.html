                            PacSnake is a fusion of Pac-Man and Snake mechanics. Players control a snake that grows by eating ghosts with a power-up, filling the board with its body. Avoid collisions with your own body or ghosts without a power-up! The goal is to score points before dying by filling the board.

Players dodge bullets, eliminate enemies, and advance through levels using the time-bending mechanic to solve combat puzzles.

Especially how this piece of code doesn't tell us where the memory leaks are happening. Since it just says "there are memory leaks" but no hint as to where, we have to guess and check multiple times.

                            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Probably the worst exercise yet. The GP Framework and SDL_ttf library don't match versions. Which means using the code from the slides did not work. Thankfully, a member in the unofficial AUT discord found the solution and was able to help me out. In the end, I was able to do it. But I BEG the slides and all of AUT content to be updated. LIKE PLEASE.</p>

                            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Since we no longer have SVN which is referenced multiple times in the exercise sheets, we no longer had the download to the FMOD library. I had to go find it manually which took a lot of time and a email registration to get the API download. After that, the actual implementation wasn't tooooo difficult mainly because there were example code provided in the FMOD API documentation which I could reference. </p>

                            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Thankfully, I made a very similar program in Java before so it wasn't too difficult. However, overall, this did took a little bit of time since I was basically working from scratch on the parser.</p>
